		<h3>Prodibi SA, Switzerland.  Software developer, summer internship 2016</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.prodibi.com/">Prodibi</a> delevelops API to display high quality images online. 
		It was my first experience as software developer.

		<h3>Inline LLC, Russia. Product manager (Web development), 2007 - 2015</h3>
		<p><a href="http://inline-ltd.ru/">Inline</a> develops B2B web services for the food industry. 
		There I got great experience building web start-up from the scratch with passionate team. 
		Mainly I worked closely with web developers, sales and designers. Literally, I was responsible
		“to discover a product that is valuable, usable and feasible”.
		Also I protected team members from interruptions to maximize productivity and 
		removed team impedements to allow the team to succeed the sprint goals.
