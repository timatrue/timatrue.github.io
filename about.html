<h1>Hi there, I'm Artem!</h1>
	<p>I'm from Saint-Petersburg. My current interests are focused on JS, Angular, Web RTC and Node.Js. 
	My goal is to become a high-level developer in the field of web&mobile development.</p>
	<p>I like to craft beautiful and functional interfaces, developing clean and simple solutions.
	</p> 
	<p>In 2009, I started out as project manager in a web start-up in Russia, where I worked for 6 years. 
	Then my steadily growing interest to look inside of development proccess led me to developer's side.</p>
