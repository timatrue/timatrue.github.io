<h1>Hi there, I'm Artem!</h1>
	<p>I'm russian from Saint-Petersburg, livining now in Lausanne, Switzerland. My current interests are focused on JS, Node.Js, Web RTC and Java. 
	My goal is to become a high-level developer in the field of web&mobile development.</p>
	<p>I like write code for a UI, developing the clean and simple solutions. 
	Also I'm really interested in a server side too. For example now I'm working on the Node.js/Socket.IO module connected with Firebase database.</p> 
	<p>In 2009, I started out as project manager in a web start-up in Russia, where I worked for 6 years. 
	Then my steadily growing interest to look inside of development proccess
	led me to developer's side. Finally, I got first experience of acting as a software developer at Prodibi, in 2016.</p>
